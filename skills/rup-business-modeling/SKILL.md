# rup-business-modeling — RUP Business Modeling Discipline

This skill covers the RUP **Business Modeling Discipline**: understanding the target organization and designing the business processes the software supports.

Grounded in *The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction* (3rd ed.), Philippe
Kruchten. Part of the `rup` family — drive the whole lifecycle through
`rup-orchestrator`, or run this discipline directly.

## Agents (2)

| Agent (slug) | Role | Artifacts |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| `business-process-analyst` | Business Process Analyst | Business Vision Document, Business Goals, Target-Organization Assessment, Business Use-Case Model, Business Actors, Business Glossary |
| `business-designer` | Business Designer | Business Analysis Model, Business Use-Case Realizations, Business Workers, Business Entities, Business Systems, Business Events, Business Rules, Supplementary Business Specifications, Business Architecture Document |

## Phase focus

Inception (initial), Elaboration

## How to run this skill — you are the LLM

This skill does not call any model: **you, the agent running it, produce the
artifacts**. The script gives you the work packet and records your result.

1. **Get the work packet** (read-only):

   ```bash
   python scripts/run.py "<briefing>" --phase <Inception|Elaboration|Construction|Transition>
   python scripts/run.py --input briefing.md --phase Elaboration     # long briefings
   ```

   It prints the RUP roles of this discipline (goal, perspective, mission), the
   **exact list of artifacts** you must write, the briefing, and the artifacts
   already recorded in `.context/` that this discipline builds on (governance +
   the earlier disciplines of the same phase).

2. **Write ONE markdown document**: a `# <Role>` per role, and a level-2
   heading `## <Artifact>` for every artifact listed. Follow the RUP conventions,
   reuse names/IDs from the earlier artifacts, state assumptions explicitly.

3. **Record it — mandatory** (the packet prints the exact command):

   ```bash
   python scripts/run.py --record doc.md --phase Elaboration "<briefing>"
   cat doc.md | python scripts/run.py --record - --phase Elaboration --input briefing.md
   ```

   The recorder checks that every required `## <Artifact>` section exists (if not,
   it lists the missing ones, writes nothing and exits `1` — add them and record
   again) and writes `.context/docs/<NN-phase>/rup-business-modeling.md` with a provenance header,
   plus a row in `.context/tracking/rup-log.md`.

## CLI contract

| Argument | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `briefing` (positional) | Business demand / context for the discipline |
| `--input <file>` | Read the briefing from a file (alternative to positional) |
| `--phase {Inception,Elaboration,Construction,Transition}` | RUP phase (default: Elaboration) |
| `--context-dir <dir>` | The `.context/` (default: `$RUP_CONTEXT_DIR`, else the nearest up to the git root) |
| `--record <file\|->` | Validate your document and write it to `.context/` |

Exit codes: `0` success · `1` usage error / missing artifacts · `4` `.context/`
not writable. Standard library only — no LLM key, no `crewai`.
